# Project4_NFL_Data_Analytics
We cleaned a series of xslx files sourced from fantasydata.com that contain statistics on NFL player performance. This data was preprocessed and combined into a single dataframe used in the creation of a machine learning model that will serve to predict a given player's performance in an upcoming season.

# Instructions
Please ensure all necessary modules are installed, you may need to install psycopg2 (pip install psycopg2) in order to run the code.
Note: our project_4.py file was used to find the most optimal model structure, but running this is not necessary for our final project_4.ipynb file.
