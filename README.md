# Project4_NFL_Data_Analytics
Data clean and preprocess a dataset consisting of NFL player performance statistics to be used in the creation of a machine learning model that will serve to predict a given player's performance in an upcoming season.
# Instructions
Please ensure all necessary modules are installed, you may need to install psycopg2 (pip install psycopg2) in order to run the code.
Note: our .py file was used to find the most optimal model structure, but is not necessary to run in our final .ipynb file
